For this part of your assessment you will have to analyse some EEG data and then answer some general questions about EEG analysis and interpret some EEG data. The EEG analysis is taught in a program called **EEGLAB**.

This whole guide can be downloaded as a PDF or word document by clicking the download button in the menu and selecting your preferred format.
