This is a companion guide to the module PSY4250 EEG for Cognitive Neuroscience and is aimed specifically at helping you with the component of the Lab Report linked to 'EEG Analysis'. Your Lab Report is worth 100% of your grade.


::: {.callout-important collapse="true" title="Lab Report Deadline"}
You should submit your final functioning EEG analysis write up as part of your Lab Report.


**Lab Report submission deadline - 10.04.26 10am**

[See instructions on how to submit your work here](13-submit.qmd)

:::

For this part of your assessment, you will have to analyse some EEG data and then answer some general questions about EEG analysis and interpret some EEG data. The EEG analysis is taught in a program called **EEGLAB**.

The resources and support in this online guide should be used in conjunction with the other forms of support available to you; in-class, via email and in one-to-ones with the module leaders. This whole guide can be downloaded as a PDF or Word document by clicking the download button in the menu and selecting your preferred format.
