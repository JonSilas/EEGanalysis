# EEG Analysis - PSY4061 Practical Cognitive Neuroscience - EEG analysis tutorial and assessment
Files associated with the EEG analysis assessment component for PSY4061 module Middlesex University - [Cogntive & Clinical Neuroscience MSc](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/cognitive-clinical-neuroscience). 

These files build an online book that are aimed at helping students learn how to navigate EEGLAB and analyse some example data as part of their assessment for the module.  

The idea is that with the help of this book and instructors in the class you should be in a good position to pass the EEG analysis assesssment component for the module.
