EEG data can take many different formats depending on how it has been recorded and if it has been processed or not. We are going to import in ‘raw’ data that is to say, data that has not been processed at all since it’s recording. The data we will take in was recorded on hardware (the actual EEG recording system) made by [Brain Products]( https://www.brainproducts.com/), the specific amplifier is called an [actiCHamp plus]( https://www.brainproducts.com/solutions/actichamp/) and we recorded data from 64 electrodes placed on scalp in a 10-20 format using an [actiCAP snap](https://www.brainproducts.com/solutions/acticap/) headset.  \n\n## How\nIn EEGLAB click the following menus:\n\n    -> File\n      -> Import data\n        -> Using EEGLAB functions and plugins\n          -> From Brain Vis. Rev. .vhdr or .ahdr file\n\n![](steps/1.png){width=\"500\"}\n\nA popup menu will appear, leave the boxes blank and click `Ok`. The defaults here are telling EEGLAB you want to import all the data (intervals) from all of the electrodes (channels). \n\n![](steps/2.png){width=\"300\"}\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Terminology\nIt's easy to get confused with a lot of different terms often used for the same thing but we'll try to help. \nThe terms \"**electrodes**\" and \"**channels**\" are often used interchangeably and refer to a single source of electrical activity measured from one specific location. \n:::\n\nOnce you've clicked `Ok` on the dialogue box you should return to the home window and you should now be able to see some information about the data you've imported. \n\n![](steps/3.png){width=\"400\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## EEGLAB Home Window\nAs you are analysing your data you will always return to the EEGLAB home window that displays useful information about your data and what you've already done to the data. As you continue along this tutorial you will learn more about what the information on the home window can tell you about your data. \n:::\n\n\n## Test yourself\n\n**Question 1** | What is the sample rate for the data you've just imported? <br><br><input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='20' data-answer='[\"1000\"]'/>\n\n**Question 2** | What is the unit of the sample rate? <br><br> <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>Hz</option><option value=''>mV</option><option value=''>mA</option><option value=''>ms</option></select>\n\n**Question 3** | What is the sample rate? <br><br> <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>The frequency of the EEG signal.</option><option value='answer'>The number of times the EEG signal is digitized per second.</option><option value=''>A small 'sample' of the data at a specific frequency.</option><option value=''>The number of oscilations at a specific frequency.</option></select>\n",
